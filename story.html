            <p>As 2024 dawned, my family and I joined the vibrant energy of the Sinulog Festival at the Sto. Ni√±o Church.  Valentine's Day brought a sweet surprise from a friend, a gift shared with my group of friends.  I also showered my parents and sister with flowers and gifts, celebrating the love we share.  A few months later, my younger sister achieved a milestone, graduating from elementary school with honors.<br>
 
Before the new school year began, my friends and I embarked on a fun outing to SM Cebu, where we enjoyed the movie "Inside Out 2" on the big screen.  We then welcomed new classmates for the 2024-2025 school year.  Despite the new faces, our journey continued as we transitioned to our third year in our course.  I cherished creating new memories with classmates and friends, navigating the highs and lows together as we pursued our dreams.<br>
 
The end of the month brought a joyous family reunion, culminating in a festive Christmas party.  Days later, my group of friends gathered at SM Jmall for our own Christmas celebration.  Just before Christmas, however, we received the heartbreaking news of my uncle's passing.  We celebrated Christmas with a bittersweet ache, missing someone who would no longer be with us.  His funeral followed before New Year's Eve, a somber reminder of life's fragility.</p>
